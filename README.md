### Virtual Machines
- `Hypervisor` is the software or tool that helps the physical server (host machine) to separate a mulitple VMs by allocating Memory and Processor efficiently.
- All Physical Server has Hypervisor, but not all Desktops have Hypervisor on its own.
- If we want to create VMs on our own, then we have to install the Hypervisor manually. Eg, Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.
##### There are two types of Hypervisor
 * Bare-Metal (Installed directly on the Hardware), Eg-VMware ESXi, Hyper-v
 * Hosted (Install on the top of OS(Windows, Mac, Linux)), Eg-VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.
